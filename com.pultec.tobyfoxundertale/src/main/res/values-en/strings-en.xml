        This application allows users to patch and run "Undertale" from Steam on their Android device.\n
        To use it, a copy of the original game must be installed on the phone.\n
        The application was developed to facilitate the portability of "Undertale", maintaining an authentic experience adapted for mobile devices.\n
        We hope you enjoy playing the game on your phone!\n
